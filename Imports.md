# Space Battles - Imports
In order to get this project to work, you will need to import a fair amount of 3rd-party content. This isn't difficult, but it does take some time.

## Unity Assets
This is the easy bit. Simply search for the following packages in the Unity store (inside the Unity editor), and download & import the files. These are all expected by the Space Battles project (as cloned) to be in their default import folders.

* ["64 Flat Game Icons"](https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/36440) by Office57
* ["Extreme Sci-Fi Lite"](https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/50727) by Aquarius Max
* ["Free SF Fighter"](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/vehicles/space/free-sf-fighter-11711) by CG Pitbull
* ["Google Material Design"](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/particles-effects/google-material-design-47141) by Adi Zhavo
* ["Mothership"](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/vehicles/space/mothership-35608) by Yuli Fernandez
* ["Planet Earth Free"](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/sci-fi/planet-earth-free-23399)
* ["SCI-FI Modular Pack Free"](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/sci-fi/sci-fi-modular-pack-free-39538) by 256px
* ["UI Tween"](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/animation/ui-tween-38583) by Adi Zhavo
* ["Volumetric Lines"](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/particles-effects/volumetric-lines-29160) by Johannes Unterguggenberger

There are 2 cases where conflicts require you to either not import some part of them, or to delete the folders after importing them:

* ["CN Controls"](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/input-management/cn-controls-joystick-touchpad-button-and-d-pad-15233) by Kirill Nadezhdin
  * Delete the folder:
    * "Assets\Standard Assets\CNControls\Examples\"

* [Unity's Standard Assets](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/essentials/asset-packs/standard-assets-32351)
  * Delete the folders:
    * "Assets\Sample Scenes\"
    * "Assets\Standard Assets\Cameras\"
    * "Assets\Standard Assets\2D\"

## External Assets
This is a little more complex. Mostly this just consists of downloading the file from an external website, copying into your Assets/ directory, and letting Unity do the rest. However, there are a few collections which require some setup.
